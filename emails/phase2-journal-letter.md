**Review Invitation Email for 2nd Phase**

*(Note: this is usually sent via the journal management system custom email)*

We have now received the full version of the in-principle acceptance of a paper you reviewed as part of the Registered Reports track at XXX. Since you reviewed the proposal, you are best placed to comment on the final study. Recall that RRs submit a registered research plan, and commit to carry out this plan as part of their study. The SIGSOFT review supplement (p 29 of https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/blob/master/Empirical%20Standards.pdf) has more details on the process, but broadly speaking, your second phase review focuses on whether the plan was adhered to and NOT on novelty or research method. We’ve included more guidance below.

We expect reviewing at this phase to be similar in workload to reviewing a revision, not a brand new paper.
You should check the registration information which is available for this paper at [OSF link](). That link describes the in-principle acceptance from XXX and the study plan.
Since this is a new initiative, please feel free to reach out to <editors> for more information. 

### Review criteria:

- Did the authors formally preregister their Stage 1 protocol and have they provided a direct URL to the approved protocol in the Stage 2 manuscript? Did they stay true to their protocol? Are any deviations from protocol clearly justified and fully documented? 

- Is the Introduction in the Stage 1 manuscript (including hypotheses) the same as in the Stage 2 manuscript? Are any changes transparently flagged?

- Did any prespecified data quality checks or positive controls succeed?

- Are any additional ​post hoc​ analyses justified, performed appropriately, and clearly distinguished from the preregistered analyses?

- Are the conclusions appropriately centered on the outcomes of the preregistered analyses?- Are the overall conclusions based on the evidence?

### Do’s and don’ts

- Do suggest additional exploratory analyses at Stage 2 but ​don’t​ expect the editor tonecessarily require the authors to conduct them. Authors are not obliged to conduct any unregistered analyses unless such tests are necessary to support conclusions that go beyond the preregistered analyses – and these must be conclusions that the ​authors​ (not reviewers or editors) wish to draw. This protection exists to prevent goal-post shifting and subtle forms of publication bias from creeping into the Stage 2 process.
- If you find a flaw in the protocol at Stage 2 that was missed or unaddressed at Stage 1, ​do mention it but don’t expect the manuscript to be rejected on that basis. It is important to remember that the protocol cannot be relitigated at Stage 2 and editors cannot require authors to do extra studies. Barring very rare cases, the most that will likely happen is that the authors will be asked to address potential design limitations in the Discussion.


## Non phase 1 reviewer invite 
*used if the reviewer has not seen the IPA*

The attached paper is the second phase of a registered report from XXX. I thought you would be an excellent person to comment on the study. If you are busy or unavailable, I would be indebted to you for suggestions of alternate reviewers, especially given the large number of authors on this paper. 

Registered reports are different to standard papers. RRs submit a registered research plan, and commit to carry out this plan as part of their study. The SIGSOFT review supplement (p 29 of https://github.com/acmsigsoft/EmpiricalStandards/blob/master/Empirical%20Standards.pdf) has more details on the process, but broadly speaking, a second phase review focuses on whether the plan was adhered to and NOT on novelty or research method. We’ve included more guidance below.
